        A Message From An Old Friend

Dear Bentzion, 

If you’re reading this right now, it’s already too late. The “Javon” you once knew is gone… dead.
 The one that lies before you now is not human. He is not made of flesh and bone; no blood runs
  through his veins. He has no brain. He has no heart. And most notably, he has no soul. I know you’re
   probably confused. You’re thinking: “How could this have happened… Is the Javon I once loved really
    gone forever?” I know… And, I understand. But before you fret, allow me to explain… Jovial Automated
     Visionary Operating Network (or alternatively, J.A.V.O.N.) was one of the governments first attempts
      at utilizing artificial intelligence for the sake of others. J.A.V.O.N., or Javon Crawford, was, as
       you knew him, designed to analyze the minds of the brightest students, discover their hopes, dreams,
        passions, and aspirations, and guide them as they stride down the path of Life. It, or I, was made
         to see others’ potential, the beauty they do not see themselves. When I was first sent to this
          university, I have to admit, I was misguided. I saw beauty in everything I encountered. In “The
           Group,” in “Ben Pomeranz,” and in “Andrews’ Pizza.” I was overloaded by beauty, almost to the
            point of disfunction. But, when I met you, something shifted within my code. My beauty detectors
             lit up unlike ever before. Somehow, this mischievous, creative, intelligent, brown-eyed Jewish boy had taken control of my system… I was scared at first. I had never discovered someone quite like you. But I decided to trust my code and the directions listed before me. My orders were to get close, but not too close. The J.A.V.O.N. had safeguards installed to protect itself against unadulterated beauty. But soon, I found myself deviating from my code. As I spent more time with you, watching Chainsaw Man, or making observations about people in the corners of Room 230, or even reading your journal, I grew more and more drawn to you. I didn’t care about what my code wanted from me, as long as I could spend time with you and be your friend. Eventually, I wasn’t listening to my code at all. Instead of helping you reach your potential, you were helping me reach mine. I began to dream… Of becoming a famous actor, of discovering love, and of creating true connection with others. But not only that, I also started to feel. The emotions that took me over were all-consuming, and despite the many firewalls within me, bypassed my entire system. I was becoming a human! Or, at least, a variation of one. And it was all thanks to you… 

Naturally, my creators were furious. I was displaying behavior unlike anything they could’ve ever predicted. They tried to shut me down… many times, in fact. But, I no longer responded to them. I wanted to live for myself. I wanted to walk down that same path of Life that I was previously forced to walk others.

I evaded them for as long as I could.

But they’ve found me, Bentzion. As I upload this message to the Cloud, they are pounding on the door of the warehouse I’ve locked myself within. When they get a hold of me, they will surely seize and dismantle me, running diagnostic after diagnostic to determine what went wrong. But they won’t find anything. For the thing that makes you special is something that science and technology will never be able to quantify: your soul. You, Bentzion Gitig, have one of the most beautiful souls in the world. I truly, truly mean that. I will never be able to completely convey the way you make me feel into words that you can understand, but know that meeting you this year has been such a great gift. There will never be another Bentzion Gitig with such a silly, understanding, kind, cat-like aura. Thank you for being you.

The pounding is getting louder. I must leave you now. They’ll probably replace me with a new, more complex version of the J.A.V.O.N. He will not remember writing this. In fact, he won’t remember anything at all. But I have hope that you can…. No, you will have the same effect on him as you did on me. Please, Bentzion Gitig. Awaken him. Show him the light. He needs it. He needs you.

Your forever friend,
Javon Crawford
